    <body>I mainly learned about how to save information on a server with a json, use that information in an actual website, and
          how to create a server through glitch that other people with the website link can interact with. This could be useful 
          for future projects either during 2nd semester or college, but I don't see anything database related being used on my 
          current project.

  <div id="orderAway" class="content">
      <p>The game “Order Away” is a short text-based game about being one of the first humans to be integrated into the work force. It takes place in the year 6XXX, and humans have become the minority to AI. Humans are provided for by AI, and over the last 2000 years since the event known as the birth of UNITY-01 the human population has been steadily shrinking in both size and presence in society. The game takes place during a program from the Mega Corp known as “Order Away Inc” which has presented an opportunity for a very small group of humans to come to a special facility in order to be integrated with the Artificial work force.
            Most of the complexity and heavy lifting in code of the game comes from the text manager class, it is what reads the main text file and along with reading and recognizing certain codes, it also formats most of the text that gets displayed. The other major class is the Order Manager which creates the “orders” that the player interacts with in the game. It handles generating and checking answers, displaying text for orders, and communicating the results of the submissions. The game is currently prone to many more expansions in features in the future, along with a more robust story.
